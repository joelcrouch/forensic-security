## SUMMARY

This forensic report investigates allegations made by Allison Origin, a graduate student at the University of Illinois, against Kelly Copy, a researcher at the same institution. Allison claims that Kelly used her stolen data and writing in a federal funding proposal. The investigation involved analyzing two digital evidence sources: a USB drive (Allison.dd) that Allison used for her research and a computer (Allison.dd) used by Kelly. The primary objectives were to determine if Kelly accessed Allison’s data and to identify any suspicious activity related to file creation and deletion. This report details the methods used, findings uncovered, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

## METHODOLOGY

The purpose of this investigation is to verify Allison Origin’s claims that Kelly Copy misappropriated her research data and used it to produce a federal funding proposal. Specifically, the investigation aims to:

1. Assess the timeline of file creation, modification, and deletion on the USB drive used by Allison.
 
2. Analyze the computer used by Kelly to identify any relevant file activities or evidence of data access.

3. Determine if there is a connection between the deleted files on Allison’s USB drive and the files present on Kelly’s computer.
