### Evidence user 'jerk' stole the MacBook
The user 'jerk' had multiple 'auth OK''s.  Jerk was able to sign in on the MAC address assigned to the MacBook.  User jerk also attempted to sign in, possibly using the owner's name, but failed many times.  This suggests that user 'jerk' had custody of the MacBook.
It would be reasonable to assume the multiple failed logins
